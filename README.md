## 📌 How It Works  
1. **Add the bot to your server**  
2. **Use slash commands** to execute actions  
3. **Watch it spam messages** in public channels  

---

## 📜 Commands  

### `/kill`  
🔹 Starts spamming a preset raid message.  

### `/kill-custom <message>`  
🔹 Spams the server with a **custom message**.  

### `/send <message> [anonymous]`  
🔹 Sends a **single message**, either publicly or anonymously.  

### `/help`  
🔹 Displays bot information and the support server link.  

## ⚙ Demonstration  

This bot is also self-hosted by me. You can invite it on our Discord server: **[dsc.gg/beignet](https://discord.gg/sc5tfyEUqD)**.  

## 🚀 Example Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For the commands to work, it is necessary to have the **'Use External Apps'** permission enabled in the current channel. Otherwise, the messages will be private and will only be seen by the user itself. 

```sh
/kill
# The bot floods the channel with pre-made raid messages
```

```sh
/kill-custom text:Hello
# The bot floods the channel with custom raid messages
```

```sh
/send text:Hello anonymous=True
# The bot sends a simple message anonymously.

/send text:Hello anonymous=False
# The bot sends a simple message, but the username of the person is visible.
```
